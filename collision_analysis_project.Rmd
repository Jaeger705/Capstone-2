This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
library(readr)
df <- read_csv("C:/Users/bigbo/Downloads/Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_-_Crashes_20240412.csv")
```

```{r}
# Check column names
print(colnames(df))

# Summing injuries ensuring column names are correct
total_injured_cyclists <- sum(df$`NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED`, na.rm = TRUE)
total_injured_pedestrians <- sum(df$`NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED`, na.rm = TRUE)
total_injured_motorists <- sum(df$`NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED`, na.rm = TRUE)

# Output the results
cat("Total Injured Cyclists:", total_injured_cyclists, "\n")
cat("Total Injured Pedestrians:", total_injured_pedestrians, "\n")
cat("Total Injured Motorists:", total_injured_motorists, "\n")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

collision_causes <- df %>%
  count(`CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1`) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

print(collision_causes)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
